# Matt Waeldner – AI Prompt & Automation Consulting (Static Site)

This is a **single-page HTML** site (Tailwind via CDN). Deploy anywhere static:

## Quick Deploy to GitHub Pages
1. Create a repo (e.g. `ai-consulting-site`).
2. Upload `index.html` (and this README).
3. In **Settings → Pages**, set **Source: Deploy from a branch**, pick `main` and root (`/`).
4. The site will publish at `https://<your-username>.github.io/<repo>/`.

## Replace Links
- Contact button: edit the `mailto:` or Calendly link in the **Contact** section.
- GitHub/LinkedIn: update hrefs in the **Contact** area and JSON‑LD block.

## Customization
- Colors and copy are all inline in `index.html`.
- For production Tailwind, you can later switch to a compiled CSS pipeline, but this CDN version is fine for a quick launch.
